# SpamEmail

If you have to reach out to your users with important information and they signed
up with a trash e-mail address you're not like to get the desired attention.This
gem checks the e-mail address domain against a blacklist of trash mail providers.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'spam_email'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spam_email

## Usage

**Be advised that the validation checks NOT if a correct e-mail address is given.
Validation will pass with empty string/`nil` value! Checking the input with
`valid_email` or at least checking `presence: true` is strongly recommendend!**

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :email, presence: true, spam_email: true
end
```

or specify a custom message with (the gem comes with en/de/fr locales):

`validates :email, presence: true, spam_email: { message: "is a blacklisted provider!" }`

If you want to add/remove providers you can use an initializer and modify `SpamEmail::Blacklist`.
To disable a provider just set the hash value for the domain to false.
You can add new domainsby modifing the hash.
